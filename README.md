# lighter-RL

This repo intends to provide simple implementations of some popular DRL algorithms AND tries to make them lighter by applying pruning, quantization.

First steps: implementations of following algorithms
TODO:
- [ ] REINFORCE
- [ ] PPO
- [ ] DDPG
- [ ] TD3
- [ ] A2C/A3C
- [x] SAC
- [ ] SAC-Discrete
